## Project summary  

### The issue we are hoping to solve  

Mental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of overall well-being. Workplace stress affects over 80% of employees, with 1 in 5 experiencing mental health challenges annually. Stigma and lack of access to personalized mental health resources further exacerbate the problem, leading to lower productivity, higher absenteeism, and employee turnover. Current solutions fail to address individual needs, preventing employees from receiving effective support.

## How our technology solution can help  

# Introducing **WellBee**
A safe, anonymous platform powered by IBM WatsonX Prompt Lab. WellBee offers personalized mental health strategies, coping mechanisms, and access to certified counselors to employees without fear of exposure or judgment.  

## Our idea  

WellBee leverages AI to foster well-being and improve workplace productivity through:  
- Anonymous, secure interactions to encourage help-seeking behavior.  
- Personalized recommendations based on natural language inputs and contextual analysis.  
- Continuous learning from user interactions to offer better, more targeted advice over time.

By addressing mental health with empathy and precision, WellBee aims to reduce workplace stress by 40% and increase productivity by up to 20%.
